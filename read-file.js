/*## Reading a File (Sync)

Write a program that takes a file name as a command line argument, reads that file and prints the contents of the file to the terminal. You will probably want to create a file for testing, for example, create a hello.txt file and put the text `Hello, world!` in it. You will use the fs.readFileSync() method to do this: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfilesync_file_options. Example output:

$ node read-file.js hello.txt
Hello, world!
$ node read-file.js another-file.txt
Some other text*/
